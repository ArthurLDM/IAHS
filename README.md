This project does not have for purpose to be published or used by anyone other than me. 
It's only made for coding performance purposes and to play against the inkeeper. 
If you decide to use it, it is at your own risk and I do not take any responsability for it.

The comments might be in french, so if there is something I cant help with... go for it. 
Feel free to contact me if you have any question
